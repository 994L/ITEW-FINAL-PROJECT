                            <p>Cabuyao, Laguna, houses the Marcos Twin Mansion, a structure steeped in history and debate. Built during Ferdinand Marcos's rule in the 80s, it stands as a symbol of a tumultuous era.

                                Its purpose remains unclear. Some say it was for the Marcos twins, while official records claim it was for government use. Regardless, the mansion became synonymous with alleged extravagance during the Marcos regime.
                                
                                Sequestered by the government after the 1986 People Power Revolution, it's now under the Presidential Commission on Good Government. The future of the Marcos Twin Mansion is undecided, with proposals ranging from museums to demolition.
                                
                                Preserved or repurposed, this landmark offers a glimpse into a turbulent past, sparking conversations about the Marcos legacy.</p>

                            <p>The history of Cabuyao, Laguna's St. Polycarp Church is intricately linked to the growth of the municipality. It was once known as Tabuko, but the natives misinterpreted the Spanish question about the location for the name of a citrus tree, leading to the name Cabuyao.

                                The first missionaries from Augustinians arrived in 1571, and then the Franciscans constructed the first church in a coastal region that was prone to flooding. On higher land within the town proper, a new church dedicated to St. Polycarp was built between 1763 and 1771.
                                
                                This church was the scene of important occasions. During the Japanese occupation, it functioned as a stable for horses and a haven for injured soldiers. In 1935, it also turned into the fatal site of a fight between Sakdalistas and the police.

                            <p>In the Philippine province of Laguna, the city of Cabuyao is home to the Pamantasan ng Cabuyao (PnC), sometimes referred to as the University of Cabuyao. Proceso "Etok" D, the mayor at the time, founded it. Aguillo, via the adoption of the April 16, 2003, authorised Municipal Ordinance 2003-059.

                                There was a satellite campus of Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) in the Cabuyao National High School prior to the founding of the Pamantasan ng Cabuyao. The LSPU was run under a memorandum of understanding between the mayor of Cabuyao Municipality and the LSPU president, which ran from 1993 until March 31, 2003.
